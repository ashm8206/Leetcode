# Keep on Trucking - check the tasks to be completed by a truck and return whether it is blocked or not
# is_blocked(required_tasks, task_from, task_to)
# required_tasks -> list of tasks that are mandatory to complete
# ith index of task_to depends on ith index of task_from

# Hint:
# Unless there is an explicit from -> to task
