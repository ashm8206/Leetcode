# Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).

class solution():
    def check_string_rotation(self, s1, s2):
        return True

obj = solution()
obj.check_string_rotation("waterbottle", "erbottlewat")     # true
